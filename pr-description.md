# Description

Configure the `CODEOWNERS` file.

# TODOs

- [ ] add your team to the first line of the `CODEOWNERS` file
- [ ] remove the `pr-description.md` file. It is no longer needed and was used to setup this PR
- [ ] remove everything from the PR body, but leave the `Description` section

# Remarks

- groups are prefixed with `@hapag-lloyd/<group-name-here>`
- use groups instead of individual users so multiple people can review PRs
- as you shouldn't change the `LICENSE` file, you shouldn't touch that line in the `CODEOWNERS` file
