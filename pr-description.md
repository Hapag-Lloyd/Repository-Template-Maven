# Description

Adds the license file to the project.

# TODOs

- [ ] rename one of the license files to `LICENSE` and remove all other license files
- [ ] remove the `pr-description.md` file. It is no longer needed and was used to setup this PR
- [ ] remove everything from the PR body, but leave the `Description` section

# Remarks

- do not use other licenses than the ones provided in the `licenses` folder due to possible legal issues
- do not change the license file in any way
